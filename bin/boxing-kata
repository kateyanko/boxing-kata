# **Importing family preferences**

# _As a Beam Shipping Manager_<br>
# _In order to ship perks_<br>
# _I want to add family member brush preferences_<br>

# To begin the boxing process the shipping manager must import family data.  When the system receives the input file then the brush color counts will be displayed in the format below.

# blue: 2
# green: 2
# pink: 1

#We specify:
# Encoding because we want our data to be in UTF-8
# Headers beacuse we want a key, value hash with the headers
# Header_converters because we want headers to be symbols
# Converters because we want all of our data in the right format, integers, strings etcâ€¦
