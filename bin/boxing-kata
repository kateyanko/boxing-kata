# **Importing family preferences**

# _As a Beam Shipping Manager_<br>
# _In order to ship perks_<br>
# _I want to add family member brush preferences_<br>

# To begin the boxing process the shipping manager must import family data.  When the system receives the input file then the brush color counts will be displayed in the format below.

# ```
# BRUSH PREFERENCES
# blue: 2
# green: 2
# pink: 1

require "csv" 
require "json"  

data = CSV.read("../spec/fixtures/family_preferences.csv", { encoding: "UTF-8", headers: true, header_converters: :symbol, converters: :all})

hashed_data = data.map { |d| d.to_hash }

colors = hashed_data.map {|x| x.values[2]}

# **Starter boxes**

# _As a Beam Shipping Manager_<br>
# _In order to ship perks_<br>
# _I want to fill starter boxes_<br>

# Now that member data has been imported the shipping manager can begin filling boxes. A family should receive starter boxes with a brush and replacement brush head for each of their preferred colors. Each member will receive one brush and one replacement head. A starter box can contain a maximum of 2 brushes and 2 replacement heads in any combination of colors. When the shipping manager presses the starter boxes button then a number of boxes are output.  Using the brush preferences example above box output will be generated in the following format:
#Print blue starter boxes

def print_starter_boxes

until $blue <= 2
  puts "STARTER BOX"
  puts "2 blue brushes"
  puts  "2 blue replacement heads"
  $blue -= 2
end

puts  $blue.to_s + " blue replacement heads"

until $green <= 2
  puts "STARTER BOX"
  puts "2 green brushes"
  puts  "2 green replacement heads"
  $green -= 2
end

puts "STARTER BOX"
puts $green.to_s + " green brushes"
puts  $green.to_s + " green replacement heads"

until $pink <= 2
  puts "STARTER BOX"
  puts "2 pink brushes"
  puts  "2 pink replacement heads"

end

end


# **Refills**

# _Aa a Beam Shipping Manager_<br>
# _In order to ship perks_<br>
# _I want to fill refill boxes_<br>

# A family should receive refill boxes with a replacement brush head for each of their preferred colors. A refill box can contain a maximum of 4 replacement heads. when the shipping manager presses the refill boxes button then a number of refill boxes are output.  Using the brush preferences example above box output will be generated in the following format:

# ```
# REFILL BOX
# 2 blue replacement heads
# 2 green replacement heads

# REFILL BOX
# 1 pink replacement head
# ```

# # If no starter boxes have been generated then output the message `PLEASE GENERATE STARTER BOXES FIRST`.

**Scheduling**

_As a Beam Shipping Manager_<br>
_In order to ship perks_<br>
_I want to schedule boxes for shipping_<br>

Members should receive perks throughout the length of the contract (1 year).  The shipping date is based on the contract effective date of the primary insured family member.  Starter boxes should be scheduled on the contract effective date.  Refills are scheduled every 90 days after that for the remainder of the year. When boxes are generated then each box should have a line appended with its schedule.

Example for a starter box:
```
STARTER BOX
2 green brushes
2 green replacement head
Schedule: 2018-01-01
```

Example for a refill box:
```
REFILL BOX
1 pink replacement head
Schedule: 2018-04-01, 2018-06-30, 2018-09-28
